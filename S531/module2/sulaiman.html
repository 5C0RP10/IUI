<p>
When the empires come for you you learn to hide it all
</p>
<p>
You learn to wind it inside strands of cloth
each clank of the loom a closing door
</p>
<p>
turn the spoon around the bowl clockwise then counter
</p>
<p>
add your spells into a pot of soup, a cup of tea,
something they can’t force you to live
</p>
<p>
without
</p>
<p>
tell it to your children at bedtime
until the shadows grow long in the corner of the room,
open the doors and walk out into the hills
</p>
<p>
Your underground means you’re underground
They didn’t try to bury us but annihilate us
some seeds die in the dark of the soil and some take well to burning
</p>
<p>
You learn to make your gods as small as a coffee cup and hide your future in it
</p>
<p>
The key to the land of the dead is inside a seed
we will return there each year
</p>
<p>
write your prayers in a new language and bend it to your will
keep it inside a filigreed silver box around your neck
</p>
<p>
<!--Make the below text blue-->
A blue bead
a blue thread
to embroider the flag of an invisible indivisible nation onto your dress
</p>
<p>
You learn to sing in a secret language
for the prisoner’s ear only
</p>
<p>
In the end, what is left of every empire?
A few coins, a few iron nails rusting in the bottom of the river,
half remembered monuments and names
</p>
<p>
But our shadows are still striding the hills at dusk and the wind moves through our olive trees
</p>
<p>
<!--Make a special section for the author bio here. It should read: Veera Sulaiman is a Finnish-Palestinian writer, organizer, Tatreez artist, and herbalist. Her written work explores the intersections of mixed identity, language, intergenerational memory, animism, art as resistance, and propaganda as art. As a descendant of Palestinian refugees, she is interested in chronicling how our world continues to end and what endures after those calamities.-->
